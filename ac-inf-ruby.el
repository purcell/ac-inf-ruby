;;; Commentary:

;; Provides an `auto-complete' source for use in `inf-ruby-mode' buffers,
;; which ties directly into the accurate inf-ruby completions mechanism.

;; Enable using:

;;     (require 'ac-inf-ruby) ;; when not installed via package.el
;;     (eval-after-load 'auto-complete
;;       '(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'inf-ruby-mode))
;;     (add-hook 'inf-ruby-mode-hook 'ac-inf-ruby-enable)

;; Optionally bind auto-complete to TAB in inf-ruby buffers:
;;     (eval-after-load 'inf-ruby '
;;       '(define-key inf-ruby-mode-map (kbd "TAB") 'auto-complete))

;;; Code:

(require 'inf-ruby)
(require 'auto-complete)

(defun ac-inf-ruby-candidates ()
  "Return completion candidates for `ac-prefix'."
  (inf-ruby-completions ac-prefix))

(defun ac-inf-ruby-prefix ()
  "Return starting position of completion prefix."
  (and inf-ruby-at-top-level-prompt-p
       (car (inf-ruby-completion-bounds-of-expr-at-point))))

(defun ac-inf-ruby-available ()
  "Return t if inf-ruby completions are available."
  (eq 'inf-ruby-mode major-mode))

(defvar ac-source-inf-ruby
  '((available . ac-inf-ruby-available)
    (candidates . ac-inf-ruby-candidates)
    (symbol . "r")
    (prefix . ac-inf-ruby-prefix))
  "Auto-complete source for `inf-ruby-mode'.")

(defun ac-inf-ruby-enable ()
  "Add `ac-source-inf-ruby' to `ac-sources' for this buffer."
